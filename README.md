# Bute treedepth solver

This repository contains a Java version and an updated C version of the Bute solver for treedepth.  These are based on the [C version](https://github.com/jamestrimble/pace2020-treedepth-solvers) submitted by the author to PACE 2020.  If you would like to compare your own solver to a published algorithm for a research paper, I recommend using the Bute-Plus solver from the earlier repository.  Otherwise, I recommend using either the Java or C version from this repository.
