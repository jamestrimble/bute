# Bute treedepth solver

This repository contains a Java version of the Bute solver for treedepth, which is based on the [C version](https://github.com/jamestrimble/pace2020-treedepth-solvers) submitted by James Trimble to PACE 2020.

The Java version is work in progress, and I hope to improve it in late 2020 and early 2021.  [Drop me an email](mailto:j.trimble.1@research.gla.ac.uk) if you have any questions.
